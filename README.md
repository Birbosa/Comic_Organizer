# Comic_Organizer

The goal of this project is to make an app that using some sort of input (manual or barcode), it will when connected to a database log the comic book in a table
The reason behind this project is to help my dad go through his comic book collection, and put aside the valueable comics to sell, seperating them from the non valuable ones.
Progress will be slow, as i do not have direct access to the comics or the scanner, due to being at college vs at home, but progress will be attempted at least once a month, or once a week, depending on schedule.
